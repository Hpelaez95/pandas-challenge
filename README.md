Using the Starter code I also used my notes as reference to work through and get the data that was required for analysis. 
Also used the preset outcomes in the starter code for reference on how to look for the results I needed to get.
I also reached out for tutoring that helped me understand how to set up my dataframes and get meaningful results.
